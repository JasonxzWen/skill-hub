# HTML Work Reports

## Overview

Turn completed work into one portable Chinese `.html` only when HTML makes the handoff shorter, clearer, or easier to scan than chat.

## Decision Rule

Use when a completed non-trivial task needs findings, tradeoffs, metrics, next actions, or a report/review/plan/status/explainer/dashboard/editor that would otherwise become a Markdown wall.

## Trigger Examples

Use this skill for requests like:

- "Turn the completed implementation summary into a visual HTML report with file evidence."
- "Create an interactive PR review report with severity filters and highlighted snippets."
- "Explain this module call path as a self-contained page with a rendered diagram."
- "Build an incident timeline page with impact, logs, and follow-up status."
- "Convert the research result into a skimmable HTML explainer with citations."
- "Make a small prompt/config editor that exports JSON or Markdown."

Do not use this skill for:

- approval gates such as "ask before pushing" or "confirm before installing"
- code implementation, bug fixes, or test runs while work is still in progress
- short answers, simple explanations, or ordinary chat summaries
- product UI or website work; use `frontend-design`
- complex bundled React/Tailwind artifacts; use `web-artifacts-builder`
- slide decks; use `frontend-slides`

## Output Contract

Write one single static `.html` as UTF-8 Chinese under `reports/` unless the repo has a better convention. Link the file and verification.

Start with a one-sentence conclusion. Prefer tables for structured, segmented, point-by-point, status, or comparison data. Keep section summaries one line, table cells phrase-like, and bullets to one judgment or action. Mark key conclusions, risks, changes, and verification with `**...**` or `==...==`. Add other visual blocks or controls only when they reduce reading effort. Use inlineable HTML/CSS and vanilla JS; runtime-cdn may reference pinned Mermaid, Markdown, sanitizer, and code-highlighting libraries, but never React, Tailwind, Vite, or another build step.

For code-changing work, include code only when prose cannot carry the point. If used, include a source file link label with line number, copy only the decisive snippet, and highlight exact lines. Keep snippets short. Add a `diff` block only when before/after evidence matters.

For complex sequence, architecture, call-path, or data-flow changes, render Mermaid in HTML only when the diagram is faster than text. Keep source fallback as hidden machine-verifiable data.

## Generator First Workflow

Prefer the internal generator:

1. Write a UTF-8 JSON input that follows `references/report-input-schema.json`; omit `renderMode` for the default `runtime-cdn` Codex-visible report, or use `pre-rendered` only when offline primary content is required.
2. Run `scripts/create-report.mjs --input <input.json> --out-dir reports --slug <name> --json`.
3. Run `scripts/validate-html-report.mjs reports/<name>.html --json --require-browser` for runtime-cdn reports.
4. Hand off the report link and the verification result.

Use hand-written HTML only for custom visual exceptions.

## Template Assets

Start from the closest template when it fits: `implementation-handoff`, `conclusion-dashboard`, `review-findings`, `research-explainer`, or `decision-matrix`.

Use `assets/components/report-ui.css` and `assets/components/report-ui.js` for cards, filters, tabs, copy buttons, hover focus, and dim/blur behavior.

## Visual And Rich Content Rules

- Put conclusion first: decision, status, top risks, next action. Prefer one sentence before details.
- Use grouped navigation that follows the report's argument, not the component inventory. Prefer groups like 摘要、变更、影响、风险、验证、下一步、细节.
- Prefer `data-table` sections for structured, segmented, point-by-point, status, comparison, or checklist-like data. Keep cells phrase-like. Use bullets for short unordered notes, one judgment or action per bullet; use diagrams, code, evidence cards, tabs, and filters only when they serve a concrete reader need.
- Render Markdown, Mermaid, and code through pinned runtime-cdn libraries by default; preserve machine-readable state, but do not show effect tags such as `Markdown rendered`, `code highlighted`, or `Source fallback`.
- Code reports need source link, line number, copied snippet, highlighted line or diff, but reports do not need code by default.
- Escape/sanitize mixed-trust content; code and paths stay inert.
- Use jump links, filters, tabs, copy buttons, selected states, and dim/blur focus without layout-shifting hover transforms. The dedicated `data-table` component may scale only the hovered cell with `transform`; the rest of the row and column should highlight without reflow.

## Failure Lessons

- 必须使用 UTF-8 中文输入和输出。连续问号乱码通常来自 PowerShell/stdin/codepage 把中文转成非 UTF-8；优先写 UTF-8 JSON 文件。
- 不要外显 Source fallback、Code source 或 rich render status。它们只应作为隐藏 fallback 和校验状态存在，否则报告会显得像调试页面。
- 浏览器、Mermaid 预渲染或验证器错误只能写入清洗后的诊断；不要把本地绝对路径、`file:///` URL、token 或原始 HTML/script 泄露到报告里。
- 代码行必须紧凑。逐行 `<span>` 之间不要插入换行文本节点，CSS 行高保持接近正常代码阅读密度。
- 不要为了展示能力硬加图标、代码、证据、Mermaid 或效果标签。组件必须服务于内容，否则它们会把目录和正文变成噪音。
- 模板先给结论，再按本次汇报的实际问题分组；避免固定套用“图表/代码/证据/验证/行动”的组件目录。
- 假定读者没耐心。能一句话讲清的内容不要拆成两句，能用三个短点讲清的内容不要堆成长段。

## Verification

Before handing off:

Run `scripts/validate-html-report.mjs`; for runtime-cdn reports, prefer `--require-browser` so Codex-visible rendering, overflow, overlap, Mermaid containment, code tokens, and controls are actually checked.

For patterns, schema, template selection, rich-content handling, and validation, read `references/html-report-patterns.md`.
