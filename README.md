# Skill Hub

Skill Hub is a curated workspace for collecting and adapting famous agent skills into Codex-friendly versions.

The current target is a small, high-signal set rather than "install everything": OpenSpec workflows, Everything Claude Code, selected Anthropic built-in skills, selected Vercel web skills, and a Codex-adapted Ralph loop.

## Current Status

- Repository initialization is in progress.
- OpenSpec scaffolding exists under `openspec/`.
- Project-local OpenSpec helper skills exist under `.codex/skills/`.
- Everything Claude Code is downloaded locally under `vendor/everything-claude-code/`.
- ECC's Codex skill surface has been imported under `.agents/skills/`.
- Vercel Labs `skills` is downloaded locally under `vendor/vercel-labs-skills/`.
- Vercel's `find-skills` skill is installed under `.agents/skills/find-skills/`.
- Vercel Labs `agent-skills` is downloaded locally under `vendor/vercel-labs-agent-skills/`.
- Selected Vercel web skills are installed under `.agents/skills/`.
- Ralph is downloaded locally under `vendor/snarktank-ralph/`.
- Ralph PRD and loop skills are installed under `.agents/skills/`, with a Codex-native runner under `scripts/ralph/`.
- ECC's Codex config and multi-agent roles are configured under `.codex/`.
- Claude Code built-in skills copied into `.codex/skills/` have been adapted for Codex; the duplicate local `skill-creator` copy was removed in favor of Codex's system skill.
- Initial Codex feature inventory is documented in `docs/`.

## Installed Sources

| Source | Local use | License/status |
|---|---|---|
| [OpenSpec](https://github.com/open-spec/openspec) | OpenSpec project scaffold and helper skills | Generated helper skills are marked MIT |
| [Everything Claude Code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) | 32 Codex-ready skills, Codex agents, config reference | MIT, vendored source ignored |
| [Anthropic Skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) / Claude built-ins | 20 adapted built-in skills in `.codex/skills/` | Per-skill license files preserved |
| [Vercel Skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) | `find-skills` discovery skill | MIT, vendored source ignored |
| [Vercel Agent Skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills) | 4 selected Web/React skills | MIT per upstream README, vendored source ignored |
| [Ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph) | PRD-to-story workflow and autonomous iteration loop adapted for Codex | MIT, vendored source ignored |
| [Karpathy-inspired guidelines](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills) | Behavioral coding principles already embedded in root `AGENTS.md` | MIT per upstream plugin metadata/README, vendored source ignored |

Superpowers is tracked as an optional upstream source but is not installed by default because its core workflow overlaps heavily with ECC and the adapted built-in skills.
The Karpathy-inspired skill is not installed as a separate trigger because its core guidance is already project-level instruction in `AGENTS.md`.

## Initial Scope

This hub will track Codex-ready adaptations for:

- Superpowers-style disciplined software development workflows.
- Everything Claude Code-style broad agent, rule, hook, and skill coverage.
- Focused specialist skills for testing, security, frontend, docs, Git, browser QA, and language ecosystems.
- Cross-harness compatibility notes for Codex App, Codex CLI, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini, and similar agent hosts.

## Core Design Principles

- Prefer source attribution over unattributed prompt copying.
- Adapt tool names and workflows to Codex instead of blindly preserving Claude Code assumptions.
- Keep skills focused, composable, and testable.
- Start with a minimal reliable profile, then add larger batteries-included packs.
- Review licenses and security posture before importing third-party content.

## Validation

Run the local validator before committing:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\validate-skills.ps1
```

In the current sandbox, `openspec` may warn as not visible even though it is installed on the host. Use `-SkipExternal` to validate only repository files:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\validate-skills.ps1 -SkipExternal
```

## Next Milestones

1. Verify MCP startup from a non-sandboxed Codex shell with credentials available.
2. Test the Ralph runner on a small disposable repo before using it on high-value branches.
3. Add small local skills only for repeated gaps such as branch finishing or systematic debugging.
4. Keep source/license notes current whenever a third-party skill is added or refreshed.
