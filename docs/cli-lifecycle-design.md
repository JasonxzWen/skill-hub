# CLI Lifecycle Design

Date: 2026-05-11

This document is the lifecycle design for turning Skill Hub into a released CLI that other repositories can use safely.

The archived OpenSpec change is `openspec/changes/archive/2026-05-12-release-cli-capability-lifecycle/`. The active specs are under `openspec/specs/`.

## Product Goal

Target repositories should be able to use Skill Hub without cloning this repository:

```powershell
npx skill-hub analyze D:\path\to\target --json
npx skill-hub install D:\path\to\target --profile minimal --agent codex --yes
npx skill-hub status D:\path\to\target --html
npx skill-hub remove D:\path\to\target --yes
```

The CLI should answer four questions:

1. What agent capabilities does this target repo already have?
2. What high-signal capabilities can Skill Hub add?
3. Which files did Skill Hub install and how have they drifted?
4. How can Skill Hub remove only the files it owns?

The archived OpenSpec change `add-agent-readiness-analysis` adds a fifth read-only question:

5. Is this target repo ready for higher-autonomy agent work?

## Command Contract

| Command | Side effect | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `analyze <target>` | Read-only by default | Inventory repo signals, existing capabilities, missing capabilities, recommendations, and conflicts. |
| `install <target>` | Mutating | Copy selected components, write `.skill-hub/lock.json`, and produce an install report. |
| `init <target>` | Mutating alias | Compatibility alias for `install` during migration. |
| `status <target>` | Read-only by default | Read the lock and current hub index, then report current, missing, modified, update-available, skipped, and unknown components. |
| `update <target> --dry-run` | Read-only | Show a replacement plan for managed components whose current index version differs from the lock. Supports `--component <id>` scoping and `--force` preview. |
| `update <target> --yes` | Mutating | Refresh schema version 2 managed components whose current file hashes still match the lock. |
| `update <target> --force --yes` | Mutating | Overwrite modified or restore missing schema version 2 lock-recorded files only; unsafe, schema version 1, skipped, and unknown records remain blockers. |
| `migrate-lock <target> --dry-run` | Read-only | Report schema version 1 records that exactly match current Skill Hub component assets and can be converted to schema version 2. |
| `migrate-lock <target> --yes` | Mutating | Convert verifiable schema version 1 records into schema version 2 records with file hashes. |
| `remove <target>` | Mutating | Remove only schema version 2 lock-recorded, unmodified managed files unless `--force` is provided for modified schema version 2 files. |
| `profiles` | Read-only | List install profiles. |
| `components` | Read-only | List installable components and metadata. |

First release command decisions:

- `install` is the canonical verb; `init` is an alias that must produce the same plan, writes, lock, report, and exit behavior.
- `update --dry-run` is the side-effect-free preview path. `update --yes` applies safe schema version 2 managed updates, and `update --force --yes` intentionally overwrites modified or restores missing schema version 2 lock-recorded files.
- `migrate-lock` is the explicit schema version 1 conversion path. It never runs implicitly inside `update`.
- Report-capable commands write to stdout unless the user passes `--output <file>`. `--html` selects HTML format; it does not imply `.skill-hub/reports/` for read-only commands.
- Mutating commands may write default reports under `.skill-hub/reports/` because they already create or modify Skill Hub-managed state.
- Mutating commands are non-interactive. `install`, `init`, `update`, `migrate-lock`, and `remove` require either `--dry-run` or `--yes`; without either flag they exit with code `2` and explain the required confirmation flag.

## CLI Options

| Option | Commands | Contract |
|---|---|---|
| `--profile <name>` | `analyze`, `install`, `init` | Selects a capability profile. Defaults to `capabilities.index.defaults.profile`. |
| `--agent <name>` | `analyze`, `install`, `init` | May be repeated. Defaults to `capabilities.index.defaults.agents`. |
| `--json` | `analyze`, `install`, `init`, `status`, `update`, `migrate-lock`, `remove` | Prints the stable JSON report to stdout. |
| `--html` | `analyze`, `install`, `init`, `status`, `update`, `migrate-lock`, `remove` | Prints HTML to stdout unless `--output` is provided. |
| `--output <file>` | reporting commands | Writes the selected report format to an explicit path. Parent directories may be created. |
| `--dry-run` | `install`, `init`, `update`, `migrate-lock`, `remove` | Plans the mutation without copying, replacing, deleting, or rewriting files. |
| `--yes` | `install`, `init`, `update`, `migrate-lock`, `remove` | Confirms mutating behavior in non-interactive use. |
| `--overwrite` | `install`, `init` | Replaces existing destinations and records the new files as managed. |
| `--force` | `update`, `remove` | For update, overwrites modified or restores missing schema version 2 lock-recorded files. For remove, allows removal of modified schema version 2 managed files. It does not override unsafe, schema version 1, skipped, unknown, or unmanaged files. |
| `--component <id>` | `update` | May be repeated to scope update preview or mutation to selected managed component ids. |

Unsupported options must fail with exit code `2`.

Relative `--output` paths resolve against the current working directory, not the target repository, unless the user explicitly includes the target path.

## Capability Analysis

`analyze` should be deterministic and evidence-based. It should combine:

- repo signals from known files such as `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `.agents/`, `.codex/`, `.claude/`, and `.opencode/`;
- component metadata from `capabilities/index.json`;
- explicit V1 detection rules using exact relative skill or config paths;
- selected `--profile` and `--agent` options.

Every recommendation should include:

- capability id or tag;
- component id;
- target agent;
- planned destination path;
- reason;
- evidence, when available;
- default action: install, skip, none, or overwrite-required.

The CLI should prefer "unknown" over false certainty. If a repo has custom skills that do not match known detection rules, the report can mark them as existing agent assets without claiming semantic equivalence.

## Agent Readiness Analysis

The `add-agent-readiness-analysis` change extends `analyze` with an opt-in `--agent-readiness` report. It is a read-only planning layer, not an installer. It should not create `.skill-hub/`, write target files, write memory, create schedules, create webhooks, commit, push, open PRs, or modify third-party services.

The report categories are:

| Category | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `context_budget` | Always-loaded instruction surfaces such as `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/`, `.agents/`, `.claude/`, and `.opencode/`, plus duplicated context risks. |
| `outcomes` | Explicit success criteria such as OpenSpec tasks, Ralph PRDs, PR templates, release checklists, and Definition of Done docs. |
| `verification` | Test, lint, typecheck, build, validation, CI, browser, and release gates. |
| `agent_routing` | Evidence that work can be decomposed through skills, roles, routines, OpenSpec changes, Ralph stories, or routing docs. |
| `automation_candidates` | Candidate recurring checks or routines, reported as reviewable plans only. |
| `learning_capture` | Reviewable locations where durable lessons can be proposed, such as docs, skill gotchas, changelogs, retrospectives, or memory-note proposals. |

## Capability Index Migration

`capabilities/index.json` should remain the install source of truth, but each component should gain lifecycle metadata:

```json
{
  "kind": "skill",
  "path": ".agents/skills/verification-loop",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "source": "everything-claude-code",
  "provides": ["completion-verification"],
  "detects": [
    { "path": ".agents/skills/verification-loop/SKILL.md" },
    { "path": ".claude/skills/verification-loop/SKILL.md" }
  ],
  "agents": ["codex", "opencode", "claude-code"],
  "risk": "low",
  "recommendation": "Adds a final verification gate before work is declared complete."
}
```

V1 detection supports only exact relative file or directory paths:

```ts
export interface PathDetectRule {
  path: string;
  agent?: AgentName;
}
```

Rules:

- `path` is relative to the target repository root.
- `path` must use forward slashes in JSON and be normalized for the local platform at runtime.
- absolute paths, `..` traversal, globs, and content matching are invalid in V1.
- a directory detect rule matches when the directory exists.
- a file detect rule matches when the file exists.

Globs, content matching, and frontmatter parsing are deferred to a later OpenSpec change.

## TypeScript Contracts

These interfaces are the implementation target. Additive fields are allowed, but the first implementation should not rename these fields without updating specs and fixtures.

```ts
export type AgentName = 'codex' | 'opencode' | 'claude-code';
export type ReportFormat = 'text' | 'json' | 'html';
export type LifecycleRisk = 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';

export interface CapabilityComponent {
  kind: 'skill' | 'config' | 'script' | 'rule' | 'hook' | 'mcp';
  path: string;
  version: string;
  source: string;
  provides: string[];
  detects: PathDetectRule[];
  agents: AgentName[];
  risk: LifecycleRisk;
  recommendation: string;
  overlapsWith?: string[];
  routing?: string;
}

export interface CapabilityFinding {
  capability: string;
  componentId: string;
  agent: AgentName;
  state: 'detected' | 'recommended' | 'conflict' | 'unknown';
  evidence: string[];
  reason: string;
  defaultAction: 'none' | 'install' | 'skip' | 'overwrite-required';
  dest?: string;
}

export interface AnalysisResult {
  schemaVersion: 1;
  generatedAt: string;
  hubVersion: string;
  targetDir: string;
  profile: string;
  agents: AgentName[];
  signals: RepoSignals;
  findings: CapabilityFinding[];
}

export interface ManagedFileRecord {
  path: string;
  sha256: string;
  size: number;
}

export interface ManagedComponentRecord {
  id: string;
  version: string;
  agent: AgentName;
  kind: string;
  source: string;
  dest: string;
  files: ManagedFileRecord[];
  installedAt: string;
  status: 'installed' | 'skipped';
}

export interface SkillHubLockV2 {
  schemaVersion: 2;
  generatedAt: string;
  hubVersion: string;
  profile: string;
  agents: AgentName[];
  components: ManagedComponentRecord[];
}

export type StatusState =
  | 'current'
  | 'missing'
  | 'modified'
  | 'update-available'
  | 'skipped'
  | 'unknown-component';

export interface StatusRow {
  id: string;
  version: string;
  latestVersion: string | null;
  agent: AgentName;
  dest: string;
  state: StatusState;
  evidence: string[];
  reason: string;
}
```

## Path And Hash Rules

- All lock paths are relative to the target repository root and serialized with forward slashes.
- Runtime path resolution must reject absolute paths and any path containing `..` traversal segments before filesystem access.
- Hashes use SHA-256 over raw file bytes and are serialized as lowercase hexadecimal.
- Directory entries are not hashed; each file under a managed destination is recorded separately.
- File records are sorted by relative path for deterministic reports.
- Removal prunes empty directories from deepest to shallowest, stopping at the target repository root and never deleting the root itself.

## Lock Ownership

`.skill-hub/lock.json` is the ownership boundary. Future schema versions should record:

- schema version;
- hub version;
- install profile;
- target agents;
- component id and component version;
- source identifier;
- relative destination;
- file list;
- hash for each managed file;
- status at install time;
- install timestamp.

The lock should use relative paths so target repos remain portable across machines.

Schema compatibility:

- Schema version 1 locks must be readable by `status`.
- Schema version 1 locks do not contain per-file hashes, so `remove --yes` must skip those components and exit `3` rather than deleting unverifiable files.
- `--force` does not override schema version 1 hash absence in the first release; force applies only to schema version 2 files that are explicitly recorded in the lock.
- Schema version 1 locks can be upgraded only by explicit `migrate-lock` when the destination exactly matches current Skill Hub component assets, or by a manual reinstall flow; V1 removal must not infer file ownership from directory names.

## Removal Safety

`remove` must never delete by loose name matching. It should:

1. read `.skill-hub/lock.json`;
2. compare current file hashes with recorded hashes;
3. delete matching managed files;
4. skip modified managed files unless `--force` is present;
5. delete `.skill-hub/lock.json` after a successful full removal;
6. prune only empty directories that were created as part of managed destinations;
7. leave unmanaged same-name skills and user-created files intact.

If no lock exists, `remove` reports that no managed installation was found and exits without deletion.

If a lock exists but lacks per-file hashes, `remove` reports a safety blocker and does not delete those components. The first release prefers a manual or future migration path over unsafe deletion.

## Update Semantics

`status` reports `update-available` when current `capabilities/index.json` component versions differ from the lock. `skill-hub update <target> --dry-run` shows the replacement plan and blockers without mutating files.

Mutating update behavior:

1. `skill-hub update <target> --yes` applies only schema version 2 component updates whose managed file hashes still match the lock.
2. `skill-hub update <target> --component <id> --yes` scopes the selected update set and leaves unselected update-available components unchanged.
3. `skill-hub update <target> --force --yes` can intentionally overwrite modified or restore missing schema version 2 lock-recorded files, but still blocks unsafe paths, schema version 1 records, skipped records, unknown components, and unmanaged files.
4. `skill-hub update <target>` without `--dry-run` or `--yes` exits with code `2` and does not mutate files.

Schema version 1 migration behavior:

1. `skill-hub migrate-lock <target> --dry-run` reports legacy records that exactly match current Skill Hub component assets.
2. `skill-hub migrate-lock <target> --yes` writes schema version 2 records with file hashes only when all selected legacy records are verifiable.
3. Divergent, missing, unsafe, skipped, or unknown legacy records block migration and leave the lock unchanged.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | Examples |
|---:|---|---|
| `0` | Command completed successfully | Recommendations found; conflicts reported by `analyze`; no lock found by idempotent `remove`; install completed with skips. |
| `1` | Unexpected runtime failure | unreadable target after validation, filesystem error, malformed current capability index, report write failure. |
| `2` | Invalid usage or unsupported request | unknown command, unsupported option, unknown profile, unsupported agent, missing `--yes` for non-dry-run mutation, invalid `--component` selector. |
| `3` | Safety blocker prevented full requested mutation | `update --yes` found modified managed files without `--force`; `migrate-lock --yes` found divergent schema version 1 records; `remove --yes` skipped modified managed files without `--force`. |

Default install conflicts are skipped and exit `0` because the command completed with a report. Safety blockers exit `3` only when the user requested a mutation that could not be fully applied.

## Report Formats

JSON is the primary contract for tests and wrappers. HTML reports should render the same data model for human review.

Recommended report families:

- `.skill-hub/reports/install-<timestamp>.html`
- `.skill-hub/reports/remove-<timestamp>.html`

For CI, JSON output should avoid timestamps in sorted arrays and ids so snapshots are stable. Timestamp fields are acceptable when tests normalize them.

Report output rules:

- `--json` prints JSON to stdout unless `--output` is supplied.
- `--html` prints HTML to stdout unless `--output` is supplied.
- `--output <file>` writes the selected format to that exact file.
- Mutating commands may additionally create timestamped reports under `.skill-hub/reports/`.
- Read-only commands must not create `.skill-hub/` unless the explicit `--output` path points there.
- Read-only HTML files should use explicit output paths such as `--output .skill-hub/reports/analyze-<timestamp>.html` when the user intentionally wants a saved report.

## Release Readiness

Before publishing, maintainers should be able to run:

```powershell
bun run validate:release
```

The release validation wraps the lower-level checks:

```powershell
bun run typecheck
bun test ./tests
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\validate-skills.ps1 -SkipExternal
bun run build
node bin\skill-hub.mjs --help
npm pack
```

The packed artifact should include:

- `bin/skill-hub.mjs`;
- built `dist/`;
- `capabilities/index.json`;
- installable `.agents/skills/`, `.codex/skills/`, `.codex/agents/`, and `.codex/config.toml` assets that are referenced by profiles;
- docs needed for user-facing reports and package context;
- `openspec/` specs and archived change records for source traceability;
- `scripts/ralph/` and `scripts/validate-skills.ps1` when they are referenced by installable components or validation docs.

It should not include ignored vendor checkouts.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Spec and docs

- Create OpenSpec proposal, design, specs, and tasks.
- Document command semantics and lock safety.
- Update README and capability map so future implementation has one product contract.

### Phase 2: Read-only analysis

- Extend capability metadata.
- Implement deterministic `analyze --json`.
- Add fixtures for empty repos, repos with existing skills, and destination conflicts.
- Lock down path detection rules before adding content or frontmatter matching.

### Phase 3: Install lifecycle

- Add `install` command and keep `init` alias.
- Extend lock records with file hashes.
- Keep existing profile install behavior compatible.
- Add schema version 1 compatibility for existing locks before writing schema version 2.

### Phase 4: Drift and removal

- Extend `status` with modified and update-available states.
- Implement `remove --dry-run` and safe `remove --yes`.
- Add `--force` only after modified-file protection is covered by tests.
- Add `update --dry-run`, `update --yes`, selected update, force update, and explicit `migrate-lock`.

### Phase 5: Release candidate

- Validate Node-only execution from `dist/`.
- Run a local package smoke test from `npm pack`.
- Update package docs and release notes.

### Phase 6: Agent readiness analysis

- Keep the `add-agent-readiness-analysis` implementation opt-in and read-only.
- Maintain deterministic fixtures for context-budget, outcomes, verification, routing, automation-candidate, and learning-capture findings.
- Defer mutating template installs, routine exports, and memory updates to later OpenSpec changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `analyze` can run on a disposable target repo without creating `.skill-hub/`.
- `analyze --json` returns stable sorted findings with capability id, component id, target agent, evidence, reason, and default action.
- `install` writes selected assets plus a lock that can drive future status and removal.
- `init` produces behavior equivalent to `install`.
- `status` reports missing, modified, and update-available managed components.
- `remove` deletes only unmodified lock-recorded files by default.
- `remove --yes` exits `3` when modified managed files block full removal, and `remove --force --yes` removes only lock-recorded files.
- Schema version 1 locks are readable by `status`, and `remove` does not delete unverifiable hashless records.
- `update --dry-run` reports replacement plans without side effects.
- `update --yes` refreshes safe schema version 2 managed components and rewrites lock metadata.
- `update --component <id> --yes` updates only selected managed components.
- `update --force --yes` overwrites or restores only schema version 2 lock-recorded files.
- `migrate-lock --yes` converts exact-match schema version 1 records into schema version 2 records with hashes.
- The package can be built and smoke-tested through the Node-compatible binary.

## Review Checklist

Before implementation starts, reviewers should be able to answer "yes" to every item:

- Are every command's side effects and default output locations explicit?
- Are all writable operations backed by tests that use disposable target repos?
- Are all delete operations lock-backed and hash-aware?
- Is every new JSON field either required by the interfaces above or explicitly optional?
- Are all target paths relative, normalized, and traversal-checked before filesystem access?
- Can a user run the released package through Node without Bun?
- Can old schema version 1 locks still be read without crashing, while `remove` avoids deleting unverifiable hashless records?
