# Source Projects And Candidates

Date: 2026-05-08

This file tracks source projects that are worth studying or adapting for Codex.

## Primary Sources

| Project | Why it matters | Codex adaptation notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | High-signal disciplined engineering workflow: brainstorming, planning, TDD, debugging, review, worktrees, and completion verification. | Optional source only for now. Not installed because ECC plus adapted built-ins already cover most workflow behavior, and installing the full pack would add trigger noise. |
| [Superpowers Codex tool mapping](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/blob/main/skills/using-superpowers/references/codex-tools.md) | Explicit mapping from Claude Code tools to Codex equivalents. | Treat as the first compatibility checklist for any ported skill. |
| [Everything Claude Code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) | Broad agent harness performance system with agents, skills, rules, hooks, MCP configs, and command shims. | Imported selectively for Codex: `.agents/skills`, `.codex/AGENTS.md`, `.codex/agents`, and adapted `.codex/config.toml`. |
| [Vercel Labs Skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) | CLI/package manager for the open agent skills ecosystem, with Codex listed as a supported agent. | Installed the bundled `find-skills` skill into `.agents/skills/find-skills` and kept the source checkout under `vendor/` for reference. |
| [Vercel Agent Skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills) | Vercel-maintained Web, React, Next.js, View Transition, deployment, and React Native skills. | Installed only the low-risk Web/React subset; deployment, token, and React Native skills remain explicit-only candidates. |
| [Ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph) | Autonomous PRD story loop that repeatedly launches a fresh coding agent until every story passes. | Installed as a Codex-specific PowerShell runner plus two focused skills. The upstream Bash runner remains reference-only because it targets Amp and Claude Code. |
| [Karpathy-inspired guidelines](https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills) | Four behavioral principles for reducing common LLM coding mistakes: clarify assumptions, keep changes simple, make surgical edits, and verify against goals. | Evaluated and not installed as a standalone skill because the same principles already live in root `AGENTS.md`; adding the skill would duplicate triggers. |
| [OpenAI Codex plugins and skills](https://openai.com/academy/codex-plugins-and-skills/) | Official explanation of Codex plugins and skills. | Use for terminology and product-aligned guidance. |

## Import Policy

- Use `skill-evaluator` for every third-party skill evaluation, including rejected candidates.
- Do not copy large third-party skill bodies without checking license and attribution.
- Prefer adaptation notes and small original Codex-native skills over bulk prompt mirroring.
- Record source URL, license, upstream version/date, and local modifications for every imported skill.
- Keep optional high-context packs behind named install profiles.
- Run security review before enabling hooks, MCP servers, shell automation, or credential-handling workflows.
